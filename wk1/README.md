# MLOps maturity model

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) encompasses practices and tools to streamline and operationalize the lifecycle of ML models. It bridges the gap between data scientists who develop models and production environments where models are deployed and maintained.
**Limitations of Jupyter Notebooks**:

1. **Scalability**: Struggle with large datasets and intensive tasks due to single kernel limitations.
2. **Version Control**: Difficult integration with systems like Git, complicating change tracking and collaboration.
3. **Reproducibility**: Mixing code with narrative makes reproducing experiments challenging; requires manual cell execution.
4. **Code Modularity**: Promotes a linear coding style, making code extraction and reuse difficult.
5. **Debugging**: Errors are harder to identify and fix compared to traditional code editors.
6. **Security**: Risk of exposing sensitive information when sharing notebooks.
7. **Performance Optimization**: Lacks profiling tools, necessitating external tools for performance improvements.

### Level 0 - Nothing Automated
### Level 1 - Devops, No MLOps
### Level 2 - Automated Training
### Level 3 - Automated Deployment
### Level 4 - Full MLOps

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) maturity measures an organizationâ€™s ability to manage and operationalize ML systems effectively. It evolves through stages:

1. **Ad hoc**: ML development is manual and lacks standardization, with minimal collaboration between data scientists and IT teams.
2. **Managed**: Basic management practices and version control are implemented, but many processes remain manual.
3. **Automated**: CI/CD pipelines automate model training, evaluation, and deployment, with improved collaboration between teams.
4. **Orchestrated**: Integrated, advanced automation tools manage complex ML workflows, focusing on reproducibility, model versioning, and scalability.
5. **Governed**: MLOps is integrated with organizational governance, emphasizing compliance, security, continuous monitoring, and model improvement.

Achieving higher MLOps maturity involves investing in infrastructure, tools, and fostering team collaboration to scale ML projects, ensure model reliability, and maximize ML value.
